# Producer consumer
Solving producer consumer multi-threading problem using 3 producers and 4 consumers (each is a thread).

Each producer should produce 40 products and stop.

Each consumer should consume 30 products and stop.

The products should be placed in a box of size 6.

The product is a random number 0-1000000.

Both the producer and consumer should print each action they do (including the product).

Instead of having a quota for each producer/consumer, I made a total quota of 120 products for all producers and a total quota of 120 products for all consumers.
